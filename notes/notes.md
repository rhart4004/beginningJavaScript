Javascript Notes
==================

Strings
-------

To create a new string

    var myName = new String( 'Ryan' );

To find the length of a string

    myName.length

IndexOf and LastIndexOf functions will search through a string and return the position of the search term

    myName.indexOf('y')
    
would return 1 (becuause 'y' is the second character in the string but strings indicies are zero based.
