Eduacation is what people do to you. Learning is what you do to youself.

You aren't going to be on top of a mountain without the internet, you will always be connected.
What you need to learn is how to learn. 

Compass over maps. Do stuff first, then figure it out. Have a very strong compass!

Stop planning everything and being prepared. Focus on being connected, always learning.

BE NOWIST!
